# TechNova
TechNova wants to modernize its user management, which currently relies on an obsolete system based on spreadsheets and paper documents. Manual management is becoming inefficient and error-prone. The goal is to develop a modern system using the Spring Framework, with a modular, scalable and intuitive architecture to manage users.
